# Facial_Key_Points_Detection
In this project, we  build, train and test a deep learning based model based on convolution, a linear networksand residual blocks.
The objective is to predict facial key points.Facial key points detection is crucial for developingemotional AI based applications like detecting customer
emotional responses, toe ads and four developing driver monitoring systems as well.This project is actually very practical and directly applicable to many industries.
